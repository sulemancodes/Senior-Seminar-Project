### Almari: A College Marketplace App

Welcome to Almari, a modern, secure, and specialized marketplace web application tailored specifically for college students in the United States. Designed to enable students to safely buy, sell, and exchange items within their college community, Almari offers a user-friendly interface and robust backend, ensuring a secure transaction environment.

#### Project Overview

Almari addresses the risks associated with traditional online marketplaces like scams and theft by providing a platform where transactions are confined to verified college students. Students can log in using their school-specific `.edu` email addresses, list items for sale, communicate via a built-in chat feature, and moreâ€”all within a secure and closed environment.

#### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login with school-provided `.edu` email addresses.
- **Item Listing:** Users can list items with details like title, description, price, and condition.
- **Advanced Search:** Filter search results by price range, condition, or category.
- **Real-Time Chat:** Communicate securely with other students using the built-in chat functionality.

#### Technologies Used
